## Task

I want to create citations like @Tufte2001[p.30, dy.-3.5cm] and show it in the margin....

... done!!!

Another citation @Labov1972[dy.-3.5cm] and @Tufte[dy.6cm]

## Problems
-  linebreak: `#margincite` is breaking the line after the citation.  

- Supplements in bib entry: `p.30` should be part of the full citation text. Something like 

````
[1] E. R. Tufte, Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Second. Chesire, Con-
necticut: Graphics Press, 2001; p.30.

````

I guess for each CSL there is a correct way to include the supplement, but you get the idea.
